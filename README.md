# Human Centered Design

This project we had the chance to enhance the experience of watching movies and podcasts for Marie.
Marie is deaf but loves to watch movies, this can sometimes be a bit complicated because the subtitles or closed captions are not really giving the best experience. Sometimes sounds are not registered in closed caption or it is not clear who is talking. In this four weeks I want to see if I can make her experience a bit better.

## The Interview

The first time I met Marie she told us a lot about her experiences with movies. She misses a lot of sounds off screen which can be very confusing at times. Also the closed captions are really "flat". We know that people can have very different ways of talking. Different tones, volumes, rhythms and pitches. She misses out on this kind of sounds. Also the descriptions of music and sounds is not really clear. She said: "What is spooky music? What does that sound like?"

## The Plan

The first thing that came up to mind was the closed captions. "How can I make this more interesting?" Maybe with color, thickness, style and/or animations. I sketched some ways how people could say things (in Dutch) and a scheme how I could make this variable. I thought of color and fonts and the background of the captions.

I also needed a way to make clear where the sounds come from and how the sound "feels" like. So I made some small sketches how I could implement this into the screen.

## The first Prototype

For the first prototype I took a scene out of a movie called The Menu. This is one of the movies Marie talked about, where one of the actors has a very unique voice. I wanted to use this scene because there are some different kind of voices and also music in the background which I could visualize. I had to start from scratch so in little time I had to figure out how to insert captions and "listen" to the timestamp of the video. I used a variable font "RobotoFlex" to be able to use the same font in different styles. I tried to create different styles with this font and also add a style on how loud people were talking.

### Feedback 01

Marie liked the idea, bud had some useful feedback that I could use for the next prototype. Sometimes it was not really clear who was talking so I should add the names where this was not clear. Also the font style was not really representing the voice of the actor so I needed to add some more characteristics to that. It was still to "flat". I wasn't able to insert all the sounds into the captions and she told me she did really miss them. Some sounds where inserted but could use a better description. For example: there was a bell and the caption was "Bell dings". Her response was: "What kind of bell? Can you describe it to me". With this question I was able to empathize much better with what she needed. Also the rhythm of how people speak was a bit lacking. I knew I could really use this feedback and a lot of new ideas already came up.

## The Second Prototype

With the feedback of the first prototype I made a lot of progress. I cut the transcript in the rhythm of the actors. I gave every actor a styling that fitted them (in my opinion) and described the sounds and music in the background as specific as possible. In the end I even added small animations to the sounds to give some sort of impression on how the sound "moves".

### Feedback 02

Marie was really enthusiastic about my second prototype. The way I tried to mimic the way Slowik talks in the scene was much better then the first prototype. I changed the text to be a bit more how he speaks instead of using strict grammar. This really improved the visualization. The only thing here was that the font's were a little to small.

She also really liked the animations I added to the sound captions but when the animations became to fast it was a bit overwhelming so I should minimize that a bit. Also some transitions in sound were not clear. For example the way a sound transformed into violins music. She asked me how this transition felt, if it was a fast transition or a really slow one. In this case I need another way to visualize this.

## The Third Prototype

### Feedback 03

## Reflection

- study situation
- ignore conventions
- prioritise identity
- add nonsense

- Waar in het process?
- Hoe zien we dat terug?
