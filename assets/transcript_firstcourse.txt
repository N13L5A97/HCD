Okay.
Yes, Chef.

Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening. 
Hello.
Hello.
Welcome to Hawthorn. I am Julian Slowik, and tonight it’ll be our pleasure to feed you.
The curtain rises.
Over the next few hours you will ingest fat, salt, sugar, protein, 
bacteria, fungi, various plants and animals, and, at times, entire ecosystems. 
But... I have to beg of you one thing. 
It’s just one. 
Do not eat.
Is he serious?
Taste. 
Savor. 
Relish. 
Consider every morsel that you place inside your mouth. 
Be mindful. 
But do not... eat. 
Our menu is too precious for that. 
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
And look around you. 
Here we are on this island. 
Accept. 
Accept all of it. 
And forgive. 
And on that note, 
food!
Yeah, yeah. Bring it, bring it.
Here they come.
Oh, wow. It’s like a marching band.
Our first course is called “The Island.” 
On your plate are plants from around the island, 
placed on rocks from the shore, covered in barely frozen, 
filtered seawater which will flavor the dish as it melts.
